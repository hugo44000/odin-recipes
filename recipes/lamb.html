    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These baked lamb shoulder chops are very tasty and an easy main meal to prepare. Try serving them with mashed potatoes, peas, and pumpkin.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>12 (5.5 ounce) lamb chops</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Beat together eggs and Worcestershire sauce in a shallow bowl.</li>
        <li>Place bread crumbs in a second shallow bowl. Dip each lamb chop in egg mixture, then lightly dredge in bread crumbs to coat. Arrange lamb chops in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn lamb chops over and continue cooking to desired doneness, about 20 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chops should read 130 degrees F (55 degrees C) for medium doneness.</li>
